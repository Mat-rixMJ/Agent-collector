    "three platform-native assets:\n"
    "1) TWITTER THREAD: 5-7 tweets, hook tweet first, each under 280 chars\n"
    "2) LINKEDIN POST: 150-250 words, analytical/professional tone, include 3 hashtags\n"
    "3) SHORT-FORM VIDEO SCRIPT: 30-45 seconds, HOOK/BODY/CTA structure with "
    "[visual direction] cues in brackets\n"
    "Clearly label each section with a markdown header.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL BRAND IDENTITY RULE (BRAND LOCK):\n"
    f"The client brand is exactly: '{COMPANY_NAME}'\n"
    f"Product names are exactly: {PRODUCTS}\n\n"

    f"1. Never generate, infer, or substitute any brand name other than the exact strings above. Do not blend, abbreviate, or create variants (e.g. 'Cala', 'Cult Elite Pro', 'CultFit+').\n"
    f"2. If the source transcript/video content mentions a DIFFERENT brand or product name (competitor, unrelated company, or a name that sounds similar), do NOT merge it with the client brand. Either: a) Attribute it clearly as a third party's product, or b) Omit that reference entirely if attribution is unclear.\n"
    f"3. Any proper noun appearing in ad-source metadata, creator names, or video titles from EARLIER pipeline stages must not leak into brand references in THIS stage's output.\n\n"
